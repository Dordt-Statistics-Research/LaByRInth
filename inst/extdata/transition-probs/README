The files in this directory are generated by multi-model-symbolics.sage. To
generate a similar file for any generation of recombinant inbred line (RIL)
plants, load multi-model-symbolics.sage in a SAGE interpreter and run the
function 'parse_probs_to_R' with the single parameter being the generation of
the plants where a value of 2 corresponds to F2, 3 corresponds to F3,
etc. Running that function will print the required text for the R file to the
console where it must be copied and pasted into a file called 'F{generation}.R'
and saved in this directory.
